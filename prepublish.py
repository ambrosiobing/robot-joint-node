"""Everything the workflow can no longer check, run here before you push.

    python prepublish.py

The authoring sources are not published. Only the Markdown edition is, and
`*.tex` is ignored, so continuous integration cannot see `sections/` or
`figures/*.tex` and cannot verify that the Markdown still matches them. Four
checks lost their input that way, and they are exactly the ones that prove the
book agrees with its source:

  * the house rules over every chapter source
  * the book-level consistency check across main.tex and the chapters
  * the per-chapter figure and project-line existence check
  * the regeneration check, that chapters/, CONTENTS.md and the figure SVGs are
    current rather than merely present

They did not stop mattering when the workflow stopped seeing them. They run
here instead, and this script refuses rather than warns, so that "I ran
prepublish" means what a green run used to mean.

The order matters. Regeneration runs first, because a stale generated file is
the failure this arrangement actually risks: with the sources ignored, editing
one no longer shows in `git status`, so nothing reminds anybody to rebuild.
Everything after it reads what the regeneration produced.

One limit is reported rather than hidden. `mdbuild.py` does not draw figures,
it copies whatever `build/fig` already holds, so the drift check only covers
the figures that have been rendered. The coverage is printed every run, and a
partial build says so out loud instead of passing quietly. `python build.py
--figures` is what fills that directory.

This script is self-contained. It reads nothing outside this repository and
depends on no other volume.
